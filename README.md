# ADA Playground

This repository contains my first forays into Ada and programming in general.
Named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) - often
known as the first computer programmer, Ada is a multi-paradigm
language famous (or rather infamous) for its extremely strong typing, explicit
concurrency and non-determinism. Compilation of Ada programs can be done via
the GNU Ada Compiler or GNAT, downloadable from the
[GNU webpage](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnat/).

# Overview

* [Math Utilities](https://github.com/hieule22/ada-playground/tree/master/mathutils),
a collection of programs for converting between bases, approximating
mathematical constants such as pi or e, testing primality among others.

* [Date Utilities](https://github.com/hieule22/ada-playground/tree/master/dateutils),
a collections of programs for manipulating and querying dates.

* [Sorting Illustration]
(https://github.com/hieule22/ada-playground/tree/master/sorting),
a collection of programs for demonstrating popular sorting algorithms.

* [Misc](https://github.com/hieule22/ada-playground/tree/master/misc),
a collection of interactive command-line games and string manipulation
libraries.
